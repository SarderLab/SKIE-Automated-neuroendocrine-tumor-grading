# SKIE-Automated-neuroendocrine-tumor-grading

This repository contains the source codes for the publication,"Automated hotspot selection and Ki-67 index quantitation from whole slide images of gastrointestinal neuroendocrine tumors", submitted to Modern Pathology journal on ##/July/2019. All algorithms were developed and written by [Darshana Govind](https://github.com/DarshanaGovind).

# Image data

Whole slide images (WSIs) of three adjacent tissue sections stained with hemotoxylin and eosin (H&E), Ki-67 alone, and double immunohistochemical staining (synaptophysin-Ki-67-hemotoxylin) from 50 gastrointestinal neuroendocrine tumor (GI-NET) biopsies are available from:
